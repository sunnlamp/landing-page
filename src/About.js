    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I enjoy JavaScript, Ruby, and all things web.</p>
    <p>Recently I've been a teaching assistant at Northwestern 
      University's Coding Bootcamp. I've been working in a small 
      team, getting a group of developers ready to get out into 
      the world and build some awesome stuff!
    </p>
    <p>I have also had a lifelong passion for music and play a 
      couple of stringed instruments. I've been in bands most of 
      my life and still love doing it for fun.
    </p>
    <p>React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails are the main tricks of my trade.
      However, I enjoy learning new technology and have been keeping 
      myself busy, on the side, learning Go.</p>
